/*
Speed Reader
In this activity you are going to create a speed reading application. It will input a single word on the screen at a time, changing to the next word after 1 second. This equates to reading at 60 Words Per Minute (WPM).

Instructions
The app should countdown from 5, and when the countdown is finished it should print one word to the screen every second. Each word replaces the other.

Open index.html and create the necessary HTML. You will need at least 3 elements.
Open script.js.
The two function names have been created for you, as well as a poem to speed read.

Fill out the necessary code that would create a countdown timer. When that timer completes, it should disappear and speed reading should begin.

var poem = "Some say the world will end in ðŸ”¥, Some say in ice. From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate. To say that for destruction ice, Is also great, And would suffice.";
var poemArray = poem.split(" ");

var mainEl = document.querySelector(".words");

document.querySelector("body").style.textAlign = "center";
document.querySelector(".words").style.fontSize = "40px";

    timeEl.textContent = secondsLeft + " seconds left till words begin.";
    if(secondsLeft === 0) {
      clearInterval(timerInterval);
      timeEl.textContent = "And GO";
      speedRead();
    }
    secondsLeft--;
